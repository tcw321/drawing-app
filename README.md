# Angular Drawing App

## Overview
A simple drawing application built with Angular that allows users to draw freehand on a canvas with color selection.

## Features
- Freehand drawing

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v16+)
- Angular CLI

### Installation
1. Clone the repository
2. Run `npm install`
3. Run `ng serve`
4. Open `http://localhost:4200/` in your browser

## Usage
- Use the color picker to select drawing color
- Click and drag on the canvas to draw
- Click "Clear Canvas" to reset the drawing

## Technologies
- Angular
- TypeScript
- HTML5 Canvas

## Development server

To start a local development server, run:

```bash
ng serve
```

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Angular CLI includes powerful code scaffolding tools. To generate a new component, run:

```bash
ng generate component component-name
```

For a complete list of available schematics (such as `components`, `directives`, or `pipes`), run:

```bash
ng generate --help
```

## Building

To build the project run:

```bash
ng build
```

This will compile your project and store the build artifacts in the `dist/` directory. By default, the production build optimizes your application for performance and speed.

## Running unit tests

To execute unit tests with the [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io) test runner, use the following command:

```bash
ng test
```

## Running end-to-end tests

For end-to-end (e2e) testing, run:

```bash
ng e2e
```

Angular CLI does not come with an end-to-end testing framework by default. You can choose one that suits your needs.
